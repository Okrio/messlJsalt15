# Model-Based EM Source Separation and Localization Wrappers

This repo contains various wrappers and drivers for running MESSL
experiments for the 2015 Jelenik Speech and Language Technologies
workshop and for the OSU submission to CHiME3.

The actual MESSL code is in the [main MESSL repo](http://github.com/mim/messl).
